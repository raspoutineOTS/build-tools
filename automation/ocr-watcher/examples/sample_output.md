## Matrix Notation

text[[620, 74, 833, 88]]
with the coefficients of each variable aligned in columns, the matrix

equation[[718, 95, 833, 145]]
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & -8 \\
5 & 0 & -5
\end{bmatrix}
\]

is called the **coefficient matrix** (or **matrix of coefficients**) of the system (3), and

equation[[718, 167, 893, 217]]
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & -8 & 8 \\
5 & 0 & -5 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (4)
\]

is called the **augmented matrix** of the system. (The second row here contains a zero because the second equation could be written as \(0 \cdot x_1 + 2x_2 - 8x_3 = 8\).) An augmented matrix of a system consists of the coefficient matrix with an added column containing the constants from the right sides of the equations.

The **size** of a matrix tells how many rows and columns it has. The augmented matrix (4) above has 3 rows and 4 columns and is called a \(3 \times 4\) (read "3 by 4") matrix. If \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, an \(m \times n\) **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers with \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns. (The number of rows always comes first.) Matrix notation will simplify the calculations in the examples that follow.
