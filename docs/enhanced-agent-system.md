## Data Quality Management

### Completeness Scoring System
- **1.0**: Complete record with all required fields
- **0.8-0.9**: High completeness, minor fields missing
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate completeness, follow-up recommended
- **<0.5**: Low completeness, follow-up required

### Incomplete Data Flags
- `INCOMPLETE_DATA_[DOMAIN]_[FIELD]`: Specific missing field
- `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`: Timeout without response
- `PARTIAL_RESPONSE`: Response received but inadequate

### Follow-up Question System
- **Language Detection**: Auto-detect original message language
- **Contextual Questions**: Reference original content and explain need
- **Timeout Management**: Domain-appropriate response timeframes
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Appropriate question formulation per language

## MCP Integration Specifications

### ElevenLabs MCP
- **Audio Transcription**: `speech_to_text()` with language detection
- **Format Support**: Multiple audio formats (ogg, mp3, wav, etc.)
- **Quality Settings**: Configurable for accuracy vs. speed

### Messaging MCP  
- **Message Retrieval**: `list_messages()` with context and media
- **Media Download**: `download_media()` for audio/documents
- **Follow-up Sending**: `send_message()` for automated questions

### Cloud Database MCP

- **Complex Queries**: Cross-domain analytics and reporting
- **Transaction Management**: ACID compliance for data integrity

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites
- ElevenLabs API access for audio transcription
- Cloud database access (Cloudflare D1 or equivalent)
- Messaging system integration
- Python environment with specialized analysis modules

### Agent Configuration Files
Place enhanced agent files in appropriate directories:
- `agents/system-orchestrator/enhanced-agent.md`
- `agents/message-processor/enhanced-agent.md`  
- `agents/data-sorter/enhanced-agent.md`
- `agents/database-manager/enhanced-agent.md`

### Database Schema Setup
Run the provided SQL scripts to add quality tracking tables:
- `data_quality_tracking` table for completeness monitoring
- `follow_up_tracking` table for question management
- Enhanced columns on domain tables for quality metadata

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Domain Analysis
```
@system-orchestrator-enhanced "Analyze this multilingual audio message and extract all relevant operational data"
```

### Missing Data Follow-up
```
@data-sorter-enhanced "Process this incomplete operational report and send follow-up questions for missing budget information"
```

### Data Quality Report  
```
@database-manager-enhanced "Generate a completeness report for all operational data from the last 30 days"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Processing**: Run analysis modules concurrently when possible
- **Caching**: Cache translation results for repeated content
- **Indexing**: Proper database indexes for quality score queries
- **Batch Operations**: Group follow-up questions for efficiency

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Data completeness trend monitoring
- Follow-up response rate tracking  
- Audio transcription quality metrics
- Cross-domain consistency validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Audio Transcription Failures**: Check format compatibility and file size limits
2. **Translation Quality**: Verify language detection accuracy
3. **Missing Follow-ups**: Confirm messaging system connectivity
4. **Database Timeouts**: Optimize queries and check connection pools

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when MCP services unavailable
- Fallback options for failed transcriptions
- Retry logic for temporary failures
- Clear error reporting to users

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encrypt audio files during processing
- Secure database connections with proper authentication
- Audit trails for all data access and modifications
- Privacy-compliant handling of multilingual content

### Access Controls
- Role-based permissions for different agent capabilities
- Secure API key management for external services
- Database-level security for sensitive operational data
- Monitoring and alerting for unauthorized access attempts

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Additional language support beyond current multilingual capabilities
- Advanced analytics and predictive modeling on quality trends
