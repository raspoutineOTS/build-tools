5. **"We need to see it work with our data first"**
   - Response: "Absolutely. We offer a 2-week proof of concept where we implement one workflow with your actual data. You'll see measurable results before making any commitment. When would be a good time to start?"

6. **"What if it doesn't work for our specific use case?"**
   - Response: "Our architecture is designed to be highly flexible. We've built a generic agent framework that can be customized to any domain. If your use case requires custom development, we offer that as an add-on service.

3. **Partnership Terms:** What commission structure for NGO networks?
   - Recommendation: 10-15% recurring commission for first year

4. **Trial Length:** 2 weeks or 30 days?
