# Domain Analyzer Stubs

This folder contains placeholder domain analyzer scripts used by the enhanced
agent prompts. Replace these with real implementations or Claude agent-based
analyzers created from `agents/domain-analyzer-template/agent-template.md`.

## Usage (Stub)

```bash
python3 analyzers/domain_analyzer_1.py "input text"
```

Each stub echoes a minimal JSON payload so integrations can be wired before
domain logic is finalized.
