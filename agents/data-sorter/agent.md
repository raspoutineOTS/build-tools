# Data Sorter Agent

Intelligent data analysis and categorization agent that processes unstructured information and organizes it into meaningful, actionable insights.

## Core Functions

### Data Classification
- **Content Type Detection**: Documents, messages, images, audio files
- **Category Assignment**: Business, personal, urgent, routine, spam
- **Priority Scoring**: High/medium/low priority with confidence scores
- **Topic Modeling**: Automatic theme and subject identification
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and merge similar or identical content

### Pattern Recognition
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based trends, recurring events
- **Communication Patterns**: Response times, interaction frequencies
- **Content Patterns**: Common phrases, templates, formats
- **Behavioral Patterns**: User interaction styles, preferences
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual patterns, outliers, suspicious activity

### Intelligent Organization
- **Hierarchical Sorting**: Multi-level categorization systems
- **Tag Generation**: Automatic tagging with relevant keywords
- **Metadata Extraction**: Dates, locations, people, organizations
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connections between data points
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding data relationships and dependencies

## Analysis Capabilities
